# Compliance Report – Structural Drawing (D.K.Z.P HIGHER PRIMARY SCHOOL)

| Section | Item | Status | Explanation & IS Clause |
|---------|------|--------|--------------------------|
| **Footing** | **Title‑block contents** | ❌ | The title block contains the drawing number, revision, and “GOOD FOR CONSTRUCTION” statement, but it **lacks** the required “statement that the schedule has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of ISO 4066” (Clause B‑6.3). |
| | **Dimensions** | ✅ | All dimensions are expressed in millimetres, which satisfies the general requirement that “all dimensions are in mm unless otherwise specified” (Clause 5). |
| | **Reinforcement details** | ❌ | No clause in the supplied context specifies the required bar spacing, lap or development lengths for footings; therefore compliance cannot be confirmed. |
| | **Clear cover** | ❌ | The context does not provide a clause prescribing clear‑cover values for footings; thus the stated 50 mm cannot be verified. |
| **Lift Pit** | – | ❌ | No lift‑pit information is present in the drawing; the IS context does not contain any lift‑pit requirements, so the absence cannot be judged compliant. |
| **Materials** | **Concrete grade** | ❌ | The context does not contain a clause that mandates a specific concrete grade for the structure; the stated M25 cannot be verified. |
| | **Cover, lap & development lengths** | ❌ | No clause in the supplied context prescribes these values; therefore compliance cannot be confirmed. |
| **Final Status** | Overall compliance | ❌ | While the drawing meets the dimensional‑in‑mm requirement, it fails to satisfy the title‑block completeness (ISO 4066 statement) and lacks verifiable reinforcement and material specifications per the provided IS clauses. |

---

### Summary

- **Footing**: Partially compliant (dimensions) but non‑compliant due to missing ISO 4066 statement and lack of reinforcement/material clauses.  
- **Lift Pit**: Not applicable / missing; cannot be verified.  
- **Materials**: Not verifiable against the supplied IS context.  

**Recommendation**: Update the title block to include the ISO 4066 statement, provide reinforcement and material details that reference the relevant IS clauses (e.g., IS 456‑1978 for concrete grades, cover, lap, and development lengths), and add any lift‑pit details if required by the project scope.
