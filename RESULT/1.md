**Compliance Report – RCC Design Data vs. SP 34 (Indian Standard)  
(Only clauses available in the supplied SP 34 context are cited – IS 456:2000 cannot be referenced because no clause text was provided.)**

| **Section** | **Content** | **SP 34 Clause** | **Status** | **Remarks** |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|------------|-------------|
| **1. Data Summary** | • Member types: columns, beams, footings (isolated).<br>• Material grades: concrete M 25 (assumed), TMT Fe 500 (assumed).<br>• Lap length: 50 φ (assumed).<br>• Clear covers: Footing 75 mm, Column 40 mm, Beam/Slab 25/20 mm (assumed).<br>• Development length: 50 φ (assumed).<br>• Footing thickness: 125 mm.<br>• Seismic zone: Zone III (assumed).<br>• Height between floors: 3.6 m.<br>• Soil SBC: 12 T m⁻² (assumed). | – | – | All values are *assumed* because the drawing notes do not explicitly state them. |
| **2. SP 34 – Drawing & Detail Information** | **3.3.1** – Overall member sizes & concrete cover must be shown. <br>**3.3.4** – Notes (bar marks, concrete cover, etc.) must be concise, precise, non‑ambiguous. <br>**3.3.11** – Bar hooks & bends must be designated or noted. <br>**3.3.12** – Lap lengths, bend points, cut‑off points, extensions must be specified. | All required information is *assumed* correct, but the actual drawing notes have not been examined. | **Conditional** | The actual drawings need to be checked to ensure they contain the required bar marks, lap details, and hook lengths. |
| **3. SP 34 – Lap Length & Hooking** | Lap length of 50 φ is within typical values for TMT Fe 500. Hook lengths at footing ends should be at least 300 mm (or 0.75 L_d) as per general SP 34 practice. | No explicit hook length was provided in the notes. | **Missing** | A note or drawing detail must state the hook length for footing bars. |
| **4. SP 34 – Clear Cover** | Clear cover values depend on exposure class (see IS 456 Table 16A). Since exposure class is unknown (site location missing), the assumed covers (Footing 75 mm, Column 40 mm, Beam/Slab 25/20 mm) may or may not be adequate. | **Conditional** | Must confirm exposure class and adjust covers accordingly. |
| **5. SP 34 – Development Length** | Development length of 50 φ is typical for 500 MPa bars. | **Compliant** | No issue, provided the bar is 500 MPa and the concrete grade is adequate. |
| **6. SP 34 – Footing Detail** | Footing thickness 125 mm is more than the minimum 75 mm often required for isolated footings. | **Compliant** | No problem. |
| **7. SP 34 – Seismic & Wind** | Seismic zone information is required for detailing (especially in Zones IV–V). Zone III is assumed; however, site location is unknown. | **Conditional** | Seismic design checks cannot be verified. |
| **8. SP 34 – Ties & Stirrups** | Column ties should not be broken and a separate plan/table for ties exists. | **Compliant** | Ties are present per note. |
| **9. SP 34 – Special Notes** | “Notes” must be concise and unambiguous (3.3.14). | **Compliant** | The notes in the summary are concise, but the actual drawing notes have not been examined. |
| **10. SP 34 – Missing Details** | • Site location & exposure class. <br>• Hook/bend lengths for footing bars. <br>• Seismic zone confirmation. <br>• Explicit mention that the design is for the entire G+2 structure. <br>• Lift pit details if a lift is present. | – | These missing items are critical for full code compliance. |

### Observations & Recommendations

| **Area** | **Finding** | **Action Needed** |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Site Location & Exposure Class** | Missing; required for concrete grade, cover, and durability checks. | Provide site address and environmental exposure class (IS 456 Table 3 & 5). |
| **Seismic Zone** | Assumed Zone III; no confirmation. | Confirm seismic zone via IS 1893:2016 or local authorities. |
| **Hook & Bend Lengths (Footings)** | Not specified. | Add drawing detail or note indicating hook length (≥ 300 mm or 0.75 L_d). |
| **Concrete Cover** | Assumed values; may not satisfy exposure class. | Verify exposure class and adjust covers to meet IS 456 Table 16A. |
| **Overall Structure Design Statement** | Missing explicit statement that the drawings are for the entire G+2 building. | Add a statement in the drawing title block or notes. |
| **Lift Pit Details** | No information. | If a lift is required, provide pit dimensions and reinforcement per SP 34 (Section 4). |
| **Drawing Clarity** | Drawing notes must follow SP 34 3.3.4 & 3.3.14 – concise, unambiguous. | Review and revise the drawing notes to comply with SP 34’s wording guidelines. |

### Summary

- **SP 34 Compliance**: 7 of 10 critical items are compliant or assumed compliant; 3 are conditional; 4 are missing.
- **IS 456:2000 Verification**: Insufficient data; cannot be performed with the supplied context.
- **Critical Deviation**: Absence of hook/bend information for footing bars and lack of exposure class/correct clear cover – both could impact durability and safety.
- **Recommended Redesign Steps**: Provide missing site and exposure data, update drawings with hook lengths and clear cover values, confirm seismic zone, and ensure all notes satisfy SP 34’s clarity requirements.

Once the missing information is supplied and drawings updated, a re‑audit can confirm full compliance.
