**RCC Design Notes Extraction --- Slab**

**Step 1: Locate the "NOTES" section**

(Sometimes labeled as *GENERAL NOTES*, *RCC NOTES*, or
*SPECIFICATIONS*).\
If missing, ask the client to provide this data

**Step 2: If NOTES are present, extract and present the following items
if they exist. If missing, ask the client to provide this data:**

**Preliminary Design Data and Material Verification**

1.  **Grade of Concrete:**\
    (e.g., M20, M25, M30)\
    Confirm grade of concrete with respect to location of site.\
    The minimum grade for RCC work must be **M20**.\
    *(IS 456:2000 --- Clause 5.3.1)*

2.  **Reinforcement Bars:**\
    Identify all bar markings (Y, T, Φ denote diameter).\
    Mention **type (HYSD/TMT)**, **grade (Fe 415/500/550)**, and **IS
    code reference (IS 1786:2008)**.\
    If grade of steel is less than Fe 500, confirm with the client.

3.  **Basic Load Data:**\
    Verify the **self-weight of the slab**, **floor finish load**, and
    **live load**.\
    Ensure the live load matches the intended occupancy (residential,
    office, etc.).\
    *(IS 875, Part 2 --- Imposed Loads)*

4.  **Seismic Zone and Wind Load Reference:**\
    Must be clearly mentioned.\
    *(IS 1893, Part 1 --- Seismic Design; IS 875, Part 3 --- Wind
    Loads)*\
    If not provided, confirm with client about the regional seismic and
    wind zone.

5.  **Development Length (Ld):**

    -   Design value should be specified (commonly **50 Φ** or per IS
        456:2000, Cl. 26.2).

    -   Verify bars at discontinuous supports and points of curtailment
        are extended ≥ Ld to ensure anchorage.

    -   Ensure bar bends and hooks are as per IS SP 34 detailing.

6.  **Lap Length:**

    -   If bar length exceeds **12 m**, a lap joint must be provided.

    -   Overlap length must comply with IS 456:2000, Cl. 26.2.5, and IS
        SP 34.

    -   If the lap is \< 50 × dia, verify formula-based compliance per
        SP 34.

    -   Client must mention lap provision and proper binding in the
        plan.

7.  **Slab Type Identification:**\
    Confirm whether the slab is:

    -   **One-way** (Ly/Lx ≥ 2), or

    -   **Two-way** (Ly/Lx \< 2).\
        *(IS 456:2000, Cl. 24.1)*\
        The detailing and bar layout must match the slab type.

8.  **Clear Cover:**\
    Acceptable range for slabs is **20 mm to 25 mm**, based on exposure
    condition.\
    *(IS 456:2000, Cl. 26.4; Table 16)*

9.  **Minimum Reinforcement:**\
    The minimum area of reinforcement must be ≥ **0.12% of gross
    cross-sectional area** (for Fe 415/500).\
    *(IS 456:2000, Cl. 26.5.2.1)*

10. **Maximum Bar Spacing:**

    -   Maximum spacing ≤ **3 × effective depth (d)** or **300 mm**,
        whichever is smaller.

    -   Spacing must be **uniform** throughout the slab.\
        *(IS 456:2000, Cl. 26.3.3)*

11. **Maximum Bar Diameter:**

    -   Bar diameter shall not exceed **1/8 of the total slab thickness
        (D)**.\
        *(IS 456:2000, Cl. 26.5.2.2)*

12. **Chair Bars:**

    -   Must be used to maintain the correct height and position of top
        reinforcement.\
        • Material: Same steel grade as main reinforcement (TMT
        Fe415/Fe500)\
        • Diameter: 12 mm or 16 mm (typical)\
        • Spacing: 1.0 m to 1.2 m c/c\
        • Height: Clear distance between top and bottom bars minus cover
        thickness.

    -   Chairs must not puncture top cover; must rest on lower
        reinforcement, not shuttering.

13. **Centering and Shuttering:**

    -   Centering must be **closed off properly** to prevent concrete
        leakage.

    -   Supports must be level and stable before concreting.

    -   Shuttering should be oiled and inspected for deformation or
        gaps.

14. **Conduit Work:**

    -   PVC conduits must be properly placed **at fixed distances**.

    -   Conduits should **not interfere** with reinforcement spacing or
        reduce cover.

    -   Crossings must be avoided in congested reinforcement zones.

15. **Column Ties after Slab Placement:**

    -   Ensure **column ties** are properly continued or added after
        slab concreting.

    -   Structural connection between column and slab must be
        uninterrupted.

16. **Construction Joints (for large slabs):**

    -   Joints should be planned at locations of minimum bending moment.

    -   Where slabs are cast in parts, the **joint must be placed at an
        angle**, not vertical.

    -   Treatment of joints must be per *(IS 456:2000, Cl. 13.4)*.

17. **Deflection Control:**

    -   Check that the span-to-depth ratio does not exceed IS 456 limits
        (Cl. 23.2.1).

    -   Long-term deflection ≤ span/250.

18. **Crack Control:**

    -   Maximum spacing between main bars ≤ 3d or 300 mm.

    -   Crack width ≤ 0.3 mm.\
        *(IS 456:2000, Cl. 35.3.2)*

19. **Slab Thickness:**

    -   Minimum 75 mm for roof slabs, 100 mm for floor slabs (depending
        on load).

    -   Verify against dead + live load combinations.

20. **Slab-to-Beam Anchorage:**

    -   Bars must be properly **anchored into the beam** with full
        development length.

    -   Verify negative steel continuity over supports for continuous
        slabs.

21. **Surface Finishing and Curing:**

    -   Ensure curing period ≥ 7 days for OPC and 10 days for blended
        cement.\
        *(IS 456:2000, Cl. 13.5.1)*

    -   Check finishing consistency and slope for drainage (if roof
        slab).

**Step 3:** Output the result as a \*\*checklist table\*\*

\- \*\*Criteria\*\* (the item being checked)

**Step 4:** If any of the above items are missing or wrong, explicitly
list them under \*\*"Missing or Wrong Information according to
compliance check"\*\* so the user can provide input manually.
